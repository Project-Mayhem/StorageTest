# Storage Test

This directory includes the containers used to perform storage system testing as well and scripts and template YAML files to run the containers on a Kubernetes cluster. Test results are written to the logs but can also be written to Elasticsearch provided that host IP address, port, and login credentials are supplied.

The container definitions, Docker files and supporting scripts can be found in the containers directory. Kubernetes scripts and YAML files can be found in the k8s directory.
